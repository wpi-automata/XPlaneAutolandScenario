Data Origin and Model List: 
Note: I think I may have accidently cut some files over to my personal computer instead of copying, going to cross-check and update as needed 


12-13: Makai's Original Data Set, Run through 8-7 Model 
1-15: Makai's Original Data Set, Run through 8-7 Model
    - Wrong Model...
2-27: WPI Data Set 12464, Run through 12-6 Model 
    - Data inaccurate due to desktop resolution inconsistencies between LL and WPI and camera position differences 
3-3: Makai's Original Data Set (12464), Run through 12-6 Model 
    - Should be the most representative of the network 
3-20: Run LL12464 data through LL and WPI networks and WPI12464 data through LL and WPI networks in order to test networks on data they weren't trained on (currently missing)
3-25, 3-26, 3-31: Also don't remember exactly what these were. Will check MATLAB shortly. 
4-2: Running WPI dataset 50-10 through 4-1 network to test in-distribution data 
4-9 through 4-30: Running OOD data at various distances (100-450) to test OOD data. (350-450 is also currently missing)
